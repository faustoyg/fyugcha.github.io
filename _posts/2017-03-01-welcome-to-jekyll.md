To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
all_words = [stem(w) for w in all_words_orig if w not in ignore_words]
all_words = sorted(set(all_words))
tags = sorted(set(tags))
{% endhighlight %}
